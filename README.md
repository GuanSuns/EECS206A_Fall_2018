# EECS206A

## Introduction
All the course material and personal lab solutions of EECS 106A/206A at UC Berkeley. If you are a Cal student intereted in robotics areas, I would strongly recommend you to take this course and EECS 106B/206B. Otherwise, please refer to the `Syllabus.pdf` to check the lecture timeline and labs related, if you would prefer have a self-learning experience.

## Environment

### Software
ROS Indigo or Kinetic work well for most labs. Other dependencies for each lab need to be refered individually in the instruction pdf.
### Hardware
- Lab 3: Baxter robot
- Lab 4: Microsoft Kinetic or other configured cameras

## Lectures
Lectures are organized by following the structure of the course book [A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation](./AMathematicalIntroductiontoRoboticManipulation.pdf).

## Labs
If you have difficulties, please refer to my [personal remarks](./Labs/README.md) about lab work.
