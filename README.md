## Introduction
All the course material and personal lab solutions of EECS 106A/206A at UC Berkeley. If you are a Cal student intereted in robotics areas, I would strongly recommend you to take this course and EECS 106B/206B. Otherwise, please refer to the `Syllabus.pdf` to check the lecture timeline and labs related, if you would prefer have a self-learning experience.
## Dependencies
### Software
ROS Indigo or Kinetic work well for most labs. Other dependencies for each lab need to be refered individually in the instruction pdf.
### Hardware
- Lab 1: No hardware needed
- Lab 2: No hardware needed
- Lab 3: Baxter robot
- Lab 4: Microsoft Kinetic or other configured cameras
- Lab 5: Baxter robot
- Lab 6: Turtlebot, Microsoft Kinetic or other configured cameras
- Lab 7: Baxter robot
- Lab 8: Turtlebot, Microsoft Kinetic or other configured cameras
## Lectures
Lectures are organized by following the structure of the course book [A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation](./AMathematicalIntroductiontoRoboticManipulation.pdf). The course material convers from chapter 1 to chapter 4.
## Labs
If you have difficulties, please refer to my [personal remarks](./Labs/README.md) about lab work. I wrote some hints to the difficuilties that I have encountered or some feedback from GSIs.
